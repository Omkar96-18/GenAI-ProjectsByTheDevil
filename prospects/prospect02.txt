As a seasoned Senior Backend Engineer with a passion for open-source contribution, I am excited to be part of the "Senior Backend Expansion" campaign. With my expertise in FastAPI and Kubernetes, I have
successfully migrated legacy monoliths to microservices, achieving remarkable performance gains. My most recent project showcased a 40% latency drop across the board - a testament to the power of modern
architecture.

As an Asian-American male, I bring a unique perspective to the table. Growing up in Seattle, WA, I've had the privilege of being part of a diverse community that celebrates individuality and innovation.
My interests outside of work include trail running, brewing specialty coffee, and system design architecture - hobbies that help me maintain my creative energy.

My professional journey is reflected in my online presence, where you can find me on LinkedIn (linkedin.com/in/alexchen-backend), Instagram (instagram.com/alexcodes_), and GitHub
(github.com/alexchen-dev). My recent post analysis highlights the excitement of collaborating with an infra team to drive scalable solutions. The experience has taught me that true success lies in the
synergy between individuals from different backgrounds, skills, and perspectives.

The "Senior Backend Expansion" campaign resonates deeply with me as it prioritizes scalability and performance optimization - essential aspects of my expertise. I am eager to leverage my 5+ years of
experience as a Senior Python Engineer, proficient in Python, FastAPI, PostgreSQL, Docker, AWS, and System Design. As someone who is open to remote work, I believe my unique blend of skills and passion
for innovation will make me an asset to your team.

I look forward to connecting with like-minded professionals who share my enthusiasm for building high-performing systems that drive real results. Join me in this exciting journey as we push the
boundaries of what's possible!
