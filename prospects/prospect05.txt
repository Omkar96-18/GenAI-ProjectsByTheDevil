As a Traditional Tar Instrumentalist & Cultural Performer, I'm honored to be part of the "African Cultural Heritage Preservation Grant" campaign. With my passion for preserving Chagga musical heritage,
instrument crafting, and community workshops for youth, I've dedicated my life to sharing the rich cultural traditions of Tanzania with the world.

As a Tanzanian male, I bring a unique perspective to the table. Growing up in Moshi, Tanzania, I've had the privilege of being part of a vibrant cultural scene that celebrates our Chagga heritage. My
interests outside of work include mountain trekking around Kilimanjaro and cross-cultural collaborations.

My professional journey is reflected in my online presence, where you can find me on LinkedIn (linkedin.com/in/jumamwakyusa-music), Instagram (instagram.com/mawenzi_tar_juma), and YouTube
(youtube.com/@mawenzitartradition). My recent post analysis highlights the joy of sharing our traditional instruments with young children and the importance of preserving our cultural heritage.

The "African Cultural Heritage Preservation Grant" campaign resonates deeply with me as it prioritizes supporting traditional musicians who actively preserve and promote indigenous musical instruments
and cultural practices. I am eager to leverage my 41 years of experience as a Traditional Tar Instrumentalist & Cultural Performer, proficient in instrument crafting, community engagement, and
cross-cultural collaborations. As someone who is available for international cultural festivals, I believe my unique blend of skills and passion for preserving cultural heritage will make me an asset to
your team.

I look forward to connecting with like-minded professionals who share my enthusiasm for preserving African cultural heritage and driving real results. Join me in this exciting journey as we celebrate our
rich traditions and push the boundaries of what's possible!
